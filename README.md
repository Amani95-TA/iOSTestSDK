iOSTestSDK is a framework for iOS.

## Requirements

- iOS 10.0+
- Xcode 12.0+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift` or the Package list in Xcode.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/iOSTestSDK.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.3"))
]
```
### CocoaPods

iOSTestSDK is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'iOSTestSDK'
